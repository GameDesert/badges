# Badges

Badges are small vector graphics than can be embedded on a webpage via a remote URL.

# How to use:

To embed a badge, use one of the following:

- `<img src="https://badges.kotla.eu/badge/credits-dark.svg" alt="Badge" style="width: 125px; height: auto;">`

The `style` attribute can be used to scale the badges as needed, they are by default 125px high. The width may vary between badges. As they are .SVG files, the badge can be scaled up and down without losing clarity.
